# System Software



## Pros of using program libraries:

-more robust, which means free of error and programmer does not need to spending time to debug

-can update when improvements are avaliable

-can be called by programs by importing program library

-reduces duplication of code



## Pros of creating a program library:



-subroutines can be reused so that it need not having to be re-tested and hence reduces programmer's time



-program liberary offers continuity between programs



-programmer can contribute their specilism to the liberary, and they can use other's specialism



## Pros of using DLL:

-main memory requirements for program are reduced as dynamic link library is loaded only once / when required 



-the executable file size is smaller because the executable does not contain all the library routines 



-maintenance not needed to be done by the programmer because the DLL is separate from program 



-no need to recompile the main program when changes are made to DLL because changes to the DLL file code are done independently of the main program



-single DLL file can be made available to several application programs which saves space in memory



## Benefits of modular approach

-reduces duplication of code as modules can be called when needed

-easier to maintain

-modules can be tested once to use, so reduces time to debug

-any subsequent changes can be made once
