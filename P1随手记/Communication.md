# Communication 



## wired vs wireless



-wired has lesser interference than wireless

-hence more secure for transmitting confidential data

-direct line of sight not need for wired , unlike for wireless

-wireless is cheaper due fewer cabling

-wireless allows for portable devices

-wireless is affected by weather

-wired usually experiences less latency



## Bit streaming:



Flow of contagious sequence of digital bits over the communication path



-data is compressed before sending



-data is sent as a series of bits



-video is hosted on the central server



-to download the video, server sends the video to the buffer



-user's software receives the bit streaming from the buffer



### Real time streaming:



-being used when livestreaming



-data not have already been stored, so cannot be downloaded



### On time streaming:



-data has already been stored


-video can playback



-video can be downloaded and watch later



## Public Telephone Switch Network(PSTN)



-PSTN has many different types of lines, hence data may need to convert to a different form



-Data is sent on both directions at the same time



-The communication passes through different switching centres



## Give two benefits of storing data using cloud computing.



-Saves storage on existing devices



-Can access data from any computer with internet access



-Data can be easily shared 



## Give two drawbacks of using cloud computing.



-Data can only be accessed with internet access so reliable connection is needed



-It can take a long time to upload/download the data
